<p>“Service to humanity is one of the most endearing facets of Indian culture, the roots of which can be found in our socio-religious traditions. As stated earlier, 5G cannot remain an exclusive service to the privileged few or those in our largest cities. It must be available to every citizen, every home, and every business across India. This is a step in that direction to enable every Indian with JioTrue5G. Today, we have powered the first True5G-enabled Wi-Fi service at the holy town of Nathdwara and the temple of Lord Srinath Ji. With this, we will power many more such locations and allow them to trial our services,” said Mr.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gadgetsnow.com/topic/akash-m-ambani">Akash M Ambani</a>, Chairman, Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited.</p>

Though, users would need the invitation to experience the 5G network speeds in Chennai, similar to how it works in other cities.</p>
