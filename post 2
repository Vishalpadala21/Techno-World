<p><a href="https://www.gadgetsnow.com/topic/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a>&nbsp;is working on a feature that will automatically&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gadgetsnow.com/topic/mute">mute</a>&nbsp;large groups after the number of participants reach a specific limit, as per a report. The update will be available for beta testing users on WhatsApp for Android and aims to help reduce notifications. The development comes soon after a report suggested that the Meta-owned instant messaging app is doubling the group&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gadgetsnow.com/topic/member-limit">member limit</a>&nbsp;from the current 512 members to 1,024 participants.<br><strong><br><strong>WhatsApp will auto mute large group chats</strong></strong></p>

<p>While a bigger group size can be a good thing for people working in large organisations, or to quickly disseminate a message to a number of people, it also poses a problem. Usually, people in groups tend to share messages, images, videos, stickers, and even news throughout the day at different times.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With so many notifications coming in continuously, it could become a distraction and even nuisance for some. While WhatsApp already allows users to manually mute any group, automatically muting large groups could be a helpful addition.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As per a report by WABetaInfo, the feature is under development, hence, it is not available for beta testers. But there is a preview available for it showing how it will work if rolled out in the future.</p>

<p>A screenshot shared by the WhatsApp features tester shows that when a group has more than 256 participants, users will be shown a message informing them that the group "was automatically muted to help reduce notifications." It also says that users have an option to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gadgetsnow.com/topic/unmute">unmute</a>&nbsp;the group if they want to.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the screenshot suggests the limit for this feature to trigger by itself will be 256, the preview document says that the groups may be automatically muted after the number of members crosses the 512 mark. Moreover, clarity is needed on whether this feature will trigger when participants reach 512 or when the minimum threshold mark (which in this is 512) is crossed.<br><strong><br><strong>How to mute group notifications</strong></strong></p>
